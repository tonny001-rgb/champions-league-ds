# UEFA Champions League Data Science Project

## Overview

This is an intermediate-level data science project based on historical UEFA Champions League match data. The project focuses on applying Python-based data analysis techniques to explore match outcomes, team performance, and scoring patterns.

The aim is to practice a full data science workflow: data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight generation.

## Project Objectives

* Analyze goal-scoring patterns across seasons
* Compare team performances in different stages
* Examine home vs away match outcomes
* Identify consistently high-performing teams
* Strengthen practical data science skills using real sports data

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is:

* champions_league_matches.csv

It contains historical match-level information such as:

* Teams involved in each match
* Goals scored
* Match stages and seasons
* Home and away indicators
